Title: Summary of Information For Linear Regression Model 
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: Mimi, Li
Description: The YourPackageName R package provides a set of functions to enhance linear regression analysis in R. It includes tools for calculating and summarizing various statistical measures, including coefficients, standard errors, t-statistics, p-values, confidence intervals, residual information, R-squared values, and F-statistics.
Key Functions:
- `obtain_SSE`: Calculate the Sum of Squared Errors in a linear model.
- `obtain_se`: Obtain standard errors of the coefficients in a linear model.
- `obtain_t_stats`: Calculate t-statistics for the coefficients in a linear model.
- `obtain_p_value`: Calculate p-values for the coefficients in a linear model.
- `obtain_residual_info`: Obtain residual standard error and degrees of freedom in a linear model.
- `obtain_r_square`: Calculate R-squared and adjusted R-squared values in a linear model.
- `obtain_f_stats`: Calculate F-statistics and associated p-values in a linear model.
- `lm_summary`: Generate a summary table with detailed information on coefficients, intervals, and additional model statistics.
